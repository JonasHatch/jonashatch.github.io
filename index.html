                <h3>Who am I</h3>
                <p>I am Highschool senior and prospective Physics major at Texas A&M University. Along with study Physics I enjoy coding, writing poetry, and playing Table Top Roleplaying and War Games like D&D and Warhammer. I am a shy yet outgoing person who enjoys studying the world around me and hope to understand it in greater detail as I obtain my degree.  </p>

                    <h3>Why this Website?</h3>
                    <P>This website, while still in its infancy, will hold my curriculum vitae and resume. It will also hopefully be a place where I can share my art and poetry in a seperate blog page. It will also be used for people both in my college and not to better understand who I am as a person so that I can more easily become a part of their commmunity. Along with all this, this website is a challenge to me as a programmer as it will all be hand coded without the use of programs like Wix or Godaddy.</P>
